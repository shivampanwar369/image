		<p align="center">Foodzone is a leading food ordering and delivery startup in India. The company started operations in 2013 and is headquartered in Bengaluru.
		<br> Foodzone works by acting as a bridge between customers and restaurants. It utilizes an innovative technology platform that allows customers to order food from nearby restaurants and get it delivered at their doorstep. With Foodzone, customers do not have to keep the contact numbers of various restaurants and eateries in their locality. Foodzone works as a single point of contact for ordering food from all restaurants that may be there at a particular location. Foodzone has its own team of delivery professionals who pickup orders from restaurants and deliver it at the customer's doorstep.This has made the task of ordering food a lot easier for customers. Restaurants also gain by getting more orders and avoiding costs and efforts associated with maintaining their own delivery personnel.<br>

<h4>History:</h4><br>

The idea for Foodzone came in 2013, when the founders realized that there was a huge gap in the food ordering and delivery space. Restaurants often faced manpower problems and their delivery personnel were also not trained to deliver food in time. Swiggy started as a small setup in April 2013, with a team of eight delivery personnel and covering 20 restaurants. However, the idea soon became a huge hit among customers and restaurants alike. Foodzone now has operations in 10 cities and more than 20,000 restaurants on its platform.
